    "detail": "Apple scab is a disease of Malus trees, such as apple trees, caused by the ascomycete fungus Venturia inaequalis. The disease manifests as dull black or grey-brown lesions on the surface of tree leaves,[1] buds or fruits. Lesions may also appear less frequently on the woody tissues of the tree. Fruits and the undersides of leaves are especially susceptible. The disease rarely kills its host, but can significantly reduce fruit yields and fruit quality. Affected fruits are less marketable due to the presence of the black fungal lesions."

    "detail": "B. obtusa enters the fruit through wounds. These can be made by insects, birds or growth cracks. At first a brown spot, near the calyx, appears on the fruit.[2] The spot on the fruit then enlarges and black/brown rings appear on the fruit. The fruit holds its shape, however, unlike other fruit diseases. The fruit will then wither up and can remain on the tree for another year before falling off. During this time pycnidia appear on the surface of the rotted fruit."

    "detail": "Cedar apple rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae) is a fungal disease that requires juniper plants to complete its complicated two year life-cycle. Spores overwinter as a reddish-brown gall on young twigs of various juniper species. In early spring, during wet weather, these galls swell and bright orange masses of spores are blown by the wind where they infect susceptible apple and crab-apple trees. The spores that develop on these trees will only infect junipers the following year. From year to year, the disease must pass from junipers to apples to junipers again; it cannot spread between apple trees."

Mid- and late-season sweet cherry (Prunus avium) cultivars are commonly affected, rendering them unmarketable due to the covering of white fungal growth on the cherry surface (Fig. 1). Season long disease control of both leaves and fruit is critical to minimize overall disease pressure in the orchard and consequently to protect developing fruit from accumulating spores on their surfaces."

    "detail": "Cercospora zeae-maydis is a haploid, ascomycete fungus that causes gray leaf spot disease of corn (Zea mays). This disease was first discovered in Illinois, USA, during 1925 but has increased greatly in occurrence and severity during the past 20 years and now is an economic threat in many corn-production areas worldwide. Greater occurrence and severity of the disease have been associated with increased use of minimum-tillage agriculture. Symptoms include elongated, rectangular leaf lesions, discoloration (chlorosis), and entire leaf blight caused by coalescing lesions that can reduce yields by more than 50% under disease-favorable conditions. Gray leaf spot is an important disease throughout the United States, and is economically significant in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions. However, it also occurs in Central America, China, Europe, India, Mexico, the Philippines, Southeast Asia, and is particularly devastating in parts of South America and Africa. Effective management of gray leaf spot is essential to ensure a stable supply of food, feed and fuel from corn crops of the future."

Occasionally field corn, particularly in the southern half of the state, does become severely affected when weather conditions favor the development and spread of the rust fungus. Sweet corn is generally more susceptible than field corn. In years with exceptionally cool summers, and especially on late-planted fields or sweet corn, yield losses may occur when the leaves at and above the ears become severely diseased before grain fill is complete."

It can cause complete crop loss in warm, humid climates, but is virtually unknown in regions with arid summers.” 4 The name comes from the black fringe that borders growing brown patches on the leaves. The disease also attacks other parts of the plant,“all green parts of the vine: the shoots, leaf and fruit stems, tendrils, and fruit. The most damaging effect is to the fruit”. Grape black rot affects many grape growers throughout the United States, therefore, it is important to understand the disease life cycle and environmental conditions to best manage the disease. Once infection takes place, different methods are available to control the disease."

    "detail": "Esca, Botryosphaeria dieback, Eutypa dieback, and Phomopsis dieback make up a complex of \"trunk diseases\" caused by different wood-infecting fungi. The foliar symptom of Esca is an interveinal \"striping\". The \"stripes\", which start out as dark red in red cultivars and yellow in white cultivars, dry and become necrotic. Foliar symptoms may occur at any time during the growing season, but are most prevalent during July and August. They are often restricted to an individual shoot or to shoots originating from the same spur or cane. Symptomatic leaves can dry completely and drop prematurely. On berries, small, round, dark spots each bordered by a brown-purple ring, may occur. These fruit spots, which are better viewed on white cultivars, may appear at any time between fruit set and ripening. In severely affected vines, the berries often crack and dry or are subject to spoilage. Symptomatic fruit is found only on shoots with symptomatic leaves, but you can find shoots with symptomatic leaves and no symptomatic fruit. Cross-sectional cuts through canes, spurs, cordons, or trunks from which symptomatic shoots originate will reveal concentric rings of dark spots. Eventually the spur or cane from which symptomatic shoots originate may die. The appearance of foliar and especially fruit symptoms is inconsistent from year to year, which is thought to be due to possibly climate-induced variability in toxin production by the pathogen. A severe form of Esca known as \"apoplexy\", which is more common in Europe, results in a sudden dieback of the entire shoot or adjacent shoots, rather than a gradual development of foliar symptoms."

Both isolates can be vectored by the Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri (Kuwayana) and by the psyllid Trioza erytreae (Del Guercio).
